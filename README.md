# clockify-timeular
Use your timeular cube to track your time with clockify


# setuptools

# TODO
- make it so that it searches projects and tasks with text (also workspace)
- create proj if doesnt exist
- fix stuff with venv
- make so that it automatically runs / or at least is easy to call 

- pomodoro
- more features (tags?)
- auto generate files in appdata
- improve user interaction for updating tasks (maybe like in timeular)
- "what are you working on"
